number of new things learnt from the video: 

# to get a basic template just press ! then the enter key. 
# to get the comments in visual studio code just press ctrl and /.
# btw the ctrl and / might work for everything out there I think. 
# to give an element an Id just use 
    div#ID
# to use multiple Ids and classes with a tag just use the following thing 
   div#ID.class
# one more thing I learnt is that we can run the live server simultaneously while we make 
# changes in the program.
# class = "class1 class2" these are two classes 
# all websites are upside down trees 




# Now I'll list all the classes used in the makin of this website
